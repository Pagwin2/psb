- [ ] minify js and css when copying over instead of just copying (May just end up using Tree sitter for parsing due to lack of js packages)
    - CSS
        - https://github.com/wereHamster/haskell-css-syntax
    - JS
- [ ] setup fingerprinting in file names for css and js
- [ ] process source code blocks to syntax highlight them
    - tree sitter https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tree-sitter
        - Alternatively do the Rust <-> Haskell binding myself

    - Alternatively consider skylighting https://hackage.haskell.org/package/skylighting
- [ ] dev server setup (with live reloading)

    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fsnotify
- [ ] Make a function which takes IR and spits out some kind of table of contents
- [ ] Add rst or org support and convert markdown handling to custom parser instead of pandoc
    - [ ] Add in functionality for footnotes
-  [ ] see if performance can be improved, it shouldn't be necessary but if I'm looking at doing something for this and everything above this got checked off then this is a sensible next thing
