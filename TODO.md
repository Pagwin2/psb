- add rst support and convert markdown handling to custom parser instead of pandoc

- process source code blocks with tree sitter https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tree-sitter

- minify js and css when copying over instead of just copying

- look into adding postcss support perhaps

- see if performance can be improved (it isn't slow atm but it definitely feels like there's a bottleneck)
