- [ ] minify js and css when copying over instead of just copying
    - CSS
        - https://github.com/wereHamster/haskell-css-syntax
    - JS
        - Doing our own tokenizer lol
- [ ] swap from using `draft` to using `date` for determing draft status, lack of date = draft
- [ ] Fix timestamp(s) shown to use local offset instead of absolute time https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-4.2
- [ ] setup fingerprinting in file names for css and js
    - setup lambdas via: https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/mustache-2.4.3.1/docs/Text-Mustache.html#v:overText
    - This may require a refactor of how we handle templates to use `object` instead of just using aeson integration from the mustache crate
- [ ] process source code blocks to syntax highlight them
    - tree sitter https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tree-sitter
        - Alternatively do the Rust <-> Haskell binding myself

        - https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-highlight
        - Or potentially https://docs.rs/arborium/latest/arborium/
    - Alternatively consider skylighting https://hackage.haskell.org/package/skylighting
- [ ] setup font subsetting (font file minimization)
- [ ] dev server setup (with live reloading)
    - https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/warp-3.4.10
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fsnotify
- [ ] Make a function which takes IR and spits out some kind of table of contents
- [ ] Add rst or org support and convert markdown handling to custom parser instead of pandoc
    - [ ] Add in functionality for footnotes
-  [ ] see if performance can be improved, it shouldn't be necessary but if I'm looking at doing something for this and everything above this got checked off then this is a sensible next thing
