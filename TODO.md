- [ ] process source code blocks to syntax highlight them

        - More boring therefore more better

        - Alternatively do the Rust <-> Haskell binding myself

        - Or potentially https://docs.rs/arborium/latest/arborium/
- [ ] Make a function which takes IR and spits out some kind of table of contents
- [ ] swap from using `draft` to using `date` for determing draft status, lack of date = draft
- [ ] setup font subsetting (font file minimization)
    - `pyftsubset` (`fonttools subset`) is an external tool I can and probably should use
    for this
- [ ] Refactor template handling so templates include other templates via lambda rather than implicitly https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/mustache-2.4.3.1/docs/Text-Mustache.html#v:overText
- [ ] Fix time via timestamps potentially meaning something (via preshim?) and use local offset instead of absolute time https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-4.2
- [ ] Add rst or org support and convert markdown handling to custom parser instead of pandoc
    - [ ] Add in functionality for footnotes
        - There should be a per footnote template as well and also either the default or post template should have an attribute which handles footnotes
- [ ] dev server setup (with live reloading)

    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed
    - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fsnotify
-  [ ] see if performance can be improved, it shouldn't be necessary but if I'm looking at doing something for this and everything above this got checked off then this is a sensible next thing
